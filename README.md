# Blender Projects
 All my blender short projects.

In this repository, contains all formal and complete blender projects made by me. In each project folder, there is the project files, references and final renders.

To view the project itself, open the project file using blender. If you would like to see the final result of the projects, go to the final renders folder and if you would like to create the project on your own, use the references to help you.

Please note that the references are only available for some projects to a certain extent.
